# Comparison of the genetic maps distributed with SHAPEIT4 and EAGLE2

Phasing and imputation require the use of genetic recombination maps, typically distributed with phasing and imputation tools. Recently, [SHAPEIT4](https://github.com/odelaneau/shapeit4) and [IMPUTE5](https://jmarchini.org/impute5/) have been released with genetic maps that, as I here show, differ from those used by [SHAPEIT2](https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/genetics_software/shapeit/shapeit.html), [IMPUTE2](https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/impute_v2.html) and [EAGLE2](https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/Eagle/https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/Eagle/). This article explores these differences to shed light on potential compatibility and comparability issues.
